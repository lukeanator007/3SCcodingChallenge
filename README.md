# 3SCcodingChallenge

3SC Android Task
Task
You will be building a simple UI for the Pokemon API 
( https://pokeapi.co	).
The application should:
▪ demonstrate use of Java or Kotlin technologies.
▪ allow a user to search a list of Pokemon loaded from the API 
displaying the sprite of the pokemon and name
▪ allow the user to see a detail screen for each pokemon so they can 
read and visualise a Pokemon's statisitics (you may choose which 
of these to use!).
Getting Started
▪ The following endpoint provides a list of 
Pokemon:	https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/
▪ You may use any other endpoints and resources provided by the 
Pokeapi.
▪ Your solution should demonstrate use of version control.
The application should run in Android Studio on an Android 
Emulator. Data persistence is optional (e.g. localStorage), 
however	a backend API is not required.
Important:
▪ Please include version control history (.git directory) with your 
solution.
▪ You may use any additional third-party frameworks, components or 
dependencies.
▪ You may use any resources at your disposal for guidance, please 
provide any URLs to resources in your solution.
▪ The task will be marked on the following aspects:
▪ Technical ability - is the code quality great?
▪ Presentation skills - does it look beautiful?
▪ Documentation - are sources referenced/is the code well 
commented?
▪ Overall solution - does it work really well from a user point of view?
